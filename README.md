Crystal Game
There are four crystals on the page, with randomly assigned hidden numbers for each round.
There is a random number that will be shown to the player that they have to reach by clicking each crystal.
The player score increases based on whichever crystal they click.
If they exceed the computer's number they lose that round and all the numbers reset.
If they meet the computer's number without going over, they win that round and all the numbers reset.
Have Fun!
